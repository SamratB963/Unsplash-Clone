        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            In 2013, Unsplash launched as a Tumblr blog with 10 high-resolution photos
            that could be used for anything. Today, Unsplash powers more people and
            products than any other visual search engine in the world, with more than 100
            million images downloaded every monthâ€”more than the rest of the industry combined.
        </p>
        <p>
            Weâ€™re building a community where the principles of sharing and openness have
            taken the place of copyright and red tape. Instead of photos being hoarded and
            shut down, photos on Unsplash are given as fuel for creativity.

    <!-- Paragraph after animation image -->
    <p id = "thirdBox">Our aim is to build the most useful visual library ever created. Unsplash
        photography has led to more than <a href="creativeActs.html">3 billion creative acts</a> acts enabling people from
        everywhere to create. You donâ€™t need to know someone, or have an agent, or
        have a name to be great on Unsplash. Weâ€™re a place where creators meet
        their audience, where individuals become a community, and a source for creativity.

        <h2>What youâ€™ll be building</h2>
        <p>
            Unsplash is an ecosystem of digital products designed to support and enable
            creation. This means we spend most of our time <a href="https://unsplash.com/blog/community/">building the highest quality
                library of usable images</a>
            <a href=""></a>, figuring out how to <a href="">spread the impact of photography
                further than ever before</a>
         <a href="https://unsplash.com/blog/product/"></a>, and 
         <a href="https://unsplash.com/blog/we-just-raised-7-25-million-for-unsplash-to-build-a-new-economy-around-photography/">connecting that impact to new opportunity.</a>
