# Unsplash-Clone
Inspired from unsplash.com, a photo discovery platform.  made with JavaScript , HTML, and CSS .
We are a team of 5 members (Samrat, Aditya, Ayush, Yatharth & Sachin) and we are the students of MASAI. During our construct week in MASAI, our team was given the project of cloning the “UNSPLASH” website. This was our first project in MASAI and we were much excited to do it.

Our team met on a zoom call on Monday and we introduced each other. Later, as some of our team members do not have much clarity on how to use Github, one of our team members gave good conceptual clarity on Github. Then we have divided the project into five parts and each part was allotted separately to each person in our team.

The cloning of Unsplash website was a little bit challenging. So, we have decided to meet everyday morning at 09.30am and night at 08.00pm and discuss our challenges.

Everyday at night 8.00pm, every team member used to show the progress of his allotted part. If any of the team members have any issues regarding his part, other team members used to solve his issues and got it sorted. Every person after getting the issues solved, he used to work at night and then at the morning meeting at 9.30 am he used to show his progress which he has done after resolving his doubts.

First two days we didn’t face many challenges as many things were familiar to us. But as we dig deeper into the functionality of the website, we began to face a few challenges. We faced challenges regarding the hovering effect, the scrolling effect, how to add icons to the website and then change the color of the icon on clicking that icon, how to download the image after clicking on the download icon and so on.

But our team worked together and resolved all those issues and finally completed the cloning of Unsplash website.

On the last day of our construct week, we have recorded a 5 min video explaining everything about website and submitted our given project.

In this construct week we have learned many things which we have not learned in Masai and of course MASAI’s intention of this construct week was to learn the unlearned. In this construct week, we have learned how to work in a team, how to collaborate with team members and how to develop team leading skills, and so on.
